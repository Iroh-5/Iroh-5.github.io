Hi, my name's Max. I am a passionate person who just loves what he's doing. I love studying and exploring new things. I love listening to music, watching films, staring at sunsets surrounded by friends. Actually there're lots of things I love. But this blog isn't about all of them. It is dedicated to thing I cannot live without - programming. Yeah, I just LOVE techs, programming and all other relatable things.

In this blog I'll be posting things related to programming and computer science. There are:
* Algorithms and data structures
* Some topics I find interesting
* Pet projects
* Some insights
* Well, actually anything I want :)

If you're reading this, I hope you like what I'm doing here. Good luck, Mate!
